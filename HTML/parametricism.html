 <h1 class="boxtitle"> An Overview On Parametricism:</h1>
 <h1 class="boxtext">Parametric Architects seek to unify technology, repetition, and organic forms in one, embracing the unconventional and avant-garde. The goal is to develop a sense of spatial complexity in a structure while maintaining a degree of legibility in its design. Parametricism was pioneered throughout the early 1990s alongside early 3D animation and digital sculpting software. The style is a form of post-modern architecture in the sense that it both proceeds and evolved as a direct response to modernist architecture alongside other post-modernist styles that adamantly rejected so-called “Fordism” or the concept of mass-produced or mass-customizable architecture. The term parametric architecture was coined by Patrik Schumacher in 2008, Schumacher was a partner of Zaha Hadid, one of the greatest names in postmodernist architecture. The movement can be divided into 4 periods, proto-parametricism, which preceded its inception in the work of Frei Otto, early parametricism, parametricism 1.0, and parametricism 2.0 which Is still ongoing as of the year 2015. That being said, Parametric architecture is directly inspired by the neo-futurist style, popularized around the 1960s, which is to say that the question of whether or not parametric architecture is capable of removing itself entirely from its predecessors is questionable as there is a degree of similarity between the two movements, except for of course the many differences between their respective philosophies.
