 <h1 class="boxtitle"> An Overview On Brutalism:</h1>
 <h1 class="boxtext">Brutalism rose to popularity during the mid-1950s post-WWII through reconstruction projects among several European nations, especially the United Kingdom. Though brutalist architecture emerged originally in the UK, it is most commonly associated with socialist and communist nations, most notably the USSR. Rightfully so, as brutalism was developed with efficiency rather than aesthetics in mind, the style was developed to quickly generate cost-effective, utilitarian solutions for low-income housing, utilizing socialist principles as a sort of aesthetic and material inspiration. It is said that brutalism was a response to the modernist movement of the early 20th century, despite that, brutalism is almost the embodiment of the saying “form follows function” as coined by Louis Sullivan, a very well-known modernist architect. Regardless, I find the simplicity of brutalist architecture quite elegant despite its somewhat unglamorous utilitarian roots.  </h1>
